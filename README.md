### The Need for the Project 

Manual management and consumption of newspapers is a cumbersome task when it comes to the users who are already occupied with a lot of other stuff. Project NJ looks into this matter and makes it easy not only for the regular crowd but also for the youngsters as we are providing news to them on their most used technology, laptops, PCs,tablets. Other than providing news, NJ is capable of managing bookmarked news.

It is important for today's generation to get aware about the things happening in their surroundings and improve their general and social awareness. Newspapers now-a-days are quite outdated as people start their day with latest technologies around them and not with newspapers, also natural resources are used for their manufacturing but ultimately they end up in a dumpyard.
